# WARNING - Unmaintained

I recommend reviewing this [databricks labs](https://github.com/databrickslabs/databricks-terraform) project as an alternative.

# What does it do?

Creates a:
1. Databricks workspace in Azure
1. PAT token for accessing Databricks API
1. Cluster in Databricks workspace
1. Store the `cluster_id` and `pat_token` between runs in Terraform `state`

# Run 

1. Have `azurecli` installed and logged in, have `python3` and `pip3` installed.
1. Run `invoke-psake ./make.ps1 installRequirements`
1. Run `terraform apply -auto-approve -var 'group_name=yourGroupNameHere'` (run `terraform plan` first if you want to see what will be created)
1. See cluster created

# Dev 

The repo includes VSCode devcontainer. Clone and open the code in VSCode and enable the devcontainer. 

Info: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers

Run `Invoke-psake ./make.ps1 test` for basic unit tests or `Invoke-psake ./make.ps1 integrationTest` for a full integration test run.

# Debug

## Cluster config examples

Under `./examples` are some example cluster configurations for setting up clusters in certain ways.

## Cleanup

`databricks clusters list | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -n 1 databricks clusters delete --cluster-id`

## Logs

### Option 1 

Set `debug_log` to `true` in the terraform resource you want to debug and you'll get `cluster.[create|read|update|delete].logs` files appear after the provider executes.

```terraform
  environment = {
    debug_log        = true
  }
```

### Option 2

Set `TF_LOG=debug` then re-run the `terraform apply`. Logs like the following will be visible to show you what has happened when the scripts executed.

For example here is some output when the script path is incorrect:

```
-------------------------
[DEBUG] Command execution completed:
-------------------------

[DEBUG] Unlocked "shellScriptMutexKey"
